- data/: Contains the input documents in various formats.
- scripts/: Python scripts for preprocessing, training, and inference.
- results/: Stores output documents with extracted text.
- models/: Contains trained model files and configurations.
- logs/: Logs generated during model training and inference.

## Installation
